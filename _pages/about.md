My name is Shahnewaz Sakib and I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga.

Here’s a quick look at what I do and what I am passionate about:

- 🧠 **Trustworthy AI** – Designing systems you can understand and rely on  
- 🔐 **Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning** – Securing data through differential privacy & federated learning  
- ⚖️ **Fairness in Algorithms** – Mitigating bias in AI decision-making  
- 💬 **Explainable AI** – Making black-box models transparent and interpretable  
- 🛡️ **AI Safety & Robustness** – Defending against adversarial and unethical model behavior
