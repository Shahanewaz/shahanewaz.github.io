    <h3>üåç A Passion for Exploration</h3>
    <p>I have always loved exploring new places, and to date, I have traveled through more than 25 U.S. states. Many of those trips have taken me to national parks, scenic byways, and hidden natural gems across the country. Living in Chattanooga, Tennessee has been a perfect match for that passion. It is surrounded by beautiful landscapes and has been officially recognized as the nation's first <a href="https://chattanooga.gov/stay-informed/latest-news/its-official-chattanooga-becomes-first-national-park-city-north-america"><strong>National Park City</strong></a>, celebrating its commitment to nature, accessibility, and outdoor living.</p>
