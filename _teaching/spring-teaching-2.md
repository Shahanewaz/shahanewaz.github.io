This senior undergraduate and graduate-level course bridges the fields of cryptography and biometric systems, emphasizing both theoretical understanding and practical application. Topics include:

- Classical and modern cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES, RSA, ECC)
- Hash functions, digital signatures, and authentication protocols
- Key management and secure communication
- Biometric modalities such as fingerprint, face, and iris recognition
- Pattern recognition and statistical modeling in biometrics
- Privacy and security concerns in biometric systems
- Integration of cryptographic techniques with biometric authentication

The course features hands-on programming assignments, applied projects, and interactive presentations that encourage critical thinking about the role of security in biometric systems and identity management.
